This is my attempt to make our own basins through the TDX_Hydro network

The NEW_SCRIPT is the script that generated the best version of the global streams. Use that one. Then the downstream_df is the csv that you want out of it. 

Some of the other scripts include other methods I attempted for making basins, but none of them were as good.
